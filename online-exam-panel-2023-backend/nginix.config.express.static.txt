		## How to add phpMyAdmin 
		## Copy phpMyAdmin files to c:/winnmp/include/phpMyAdmin then uncomment:

		#location ~ ^/phpMyAdmin/.*\.php$ {
		#	root "c:/winnmp/include";
		#	try_files $uri =404; 
		#	include         nginx.fastcgi.conf;
		#	fastcgi_pass    php_farm;
		#	allow           127.0.0.1;  
		#	allow           ::1;
		#	deny            all;
		#}       
		#location ~ ^/phpMyAdmin/ {
		#	root "c:/winnmp/include";
		#}

		## Notice that the root directive lacks /phpMyAdmin because Nginx adds the URL path /phpMyAdmin to the root path, so the resulting directory is c:/winnmp/include/phpMyAdmin
